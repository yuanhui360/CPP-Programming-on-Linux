Libevent is an event notification library for developing scalable network application. The advantage of libevent is able to set network socket communication application 
using non-blocking model, so it's feasible to handle muti-connections API and improve program efficiency and performance. It's widely be used in many network communication 
related applications. The example of this short video, it's going write a C++ socket IO TCP client program using classic block pattern and a socket IO TCP client program 
using libevent mathon.
