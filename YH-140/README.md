This is the example of short video libevent-evhttp HTTP server example on my Youtube channel.
Libevent-evhttp provides a very simple event-driven HTTP interface that can be embedded in your program for making HTTP requests 
and for creating a very simple HTTP server.
The example of this video is using libevent evhttp provided http functions to build an simple HTTP server and a client 
making HTTP request.
