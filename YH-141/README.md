This video, it has demonstrated how to create an TCP client and server using libevent. As we know in these days, security becomes more and more important, and it requires to updated network communication from TCP to SSL/TLS protocol.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP.

TLS ransport Layer Security : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.

In short word : 
TCP protocol, after established socket connection, data transmitted in text mode between network communication

SSL/TLS protocol, after established socket connection, handshake and exchange RSA key, then data will be encypted and decrypted between network communication.

OpenSSL is one of most popular used library for building SSL/TLS network communication API, there are few videos in this channel it has discuss some OpenSSL topic 
In this short video, it will convert TCP client and server program to SSL/TLS using OpenSSL library.
