In this example, it's going to go back and discuss MongoDB, there are few videos early have discussed how to install MongoDB on Linux and using C++ to connect, insert and query database collections.
recently upgrade MongoCCC, compile got error that get_utf8() is deprecated and solution use document::element::get_string() instead it because new version r3.10.1 completely removed document.element.get_utf8() wihch exist in mongo-cxx-driver-r3.4.2, 
The example demonstrated how to upgrade previous program to version r3.10.1 and update MongoDB connection from remote using TLS.
