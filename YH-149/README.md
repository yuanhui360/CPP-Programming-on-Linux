In this example, we'll write a program in C/C++ to demonstrate AES CBC block cipher encryption and decryption using the wolfSSL library. 
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a strong and widely used symmetric encryption algorithm, while CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) 
is a mode of operation that provides confidentiality and integrity for data.
