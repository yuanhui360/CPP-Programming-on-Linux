this example, it will introduce libusb : A cross-platform user library to access USB devices and an open source library that allows you to communicate with USB devices from user space.

USB is an industry-standard used to specify cables, connectors, and protocols that are used for communication between electronic devices. USB ports and cables are used to connect hardware 
such as printers, scanners, keyboards, mice, flash drives, external hard drives, joysticks, cameras, monitors, and more to computers of all kinds.

In this example, it's a C++ program to find USB devices attached to system, and provides a basic introduction on how to using libusb in a C++ application on Linux.  
From here, it's able to explore more advanced features of the libusb library to interact with USB devices in more sophisticated ways.
