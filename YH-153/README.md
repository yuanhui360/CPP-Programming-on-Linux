This example, it will explorering how to perform I/O communication with USB flush device.  USB flush drive is kind of USB Mass Storage class device, 
also known as USB MSC or UMS, is a set of computing communications protocols, (specifically a USB Device Class) that enables file transfers between the host and the USB device.
To a host, the USB device acts as an external hard drive; the protocol sets interfaces with a number of storage devices.

Here we are going to write a C++ program libusb_test_flush.cpp to perform I/O communication between host and USB device, an USB Mass Storage Class device.
