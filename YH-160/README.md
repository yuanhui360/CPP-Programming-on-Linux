The SSH protocol is widely used in network communication for secure data transmission and logging into remote systems over an unsecured network. SSH keys play a vital role in this process.

SSH servers commonly support RSA, DSA, and Ed25519, some of the most popular cryptographic key types. Here Ed25519 is an SSH key type based on the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA), offering strong security and performance advantages over older key types like RSA.  It is widely recommended for modern SSH authentication.

The example provided in this video uses a simplified version of the Linux ssh-keygen command which the SSH key file is typically generated using this command.
